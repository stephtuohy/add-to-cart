# AddToCart

My first project using Agular.
Diving into a skill I haven't tried yet.
It took me the spare time I had over the weekend to watch and learn from some tutorials and build what you see here in this project.

This is using Angular 17 
please npm install

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
